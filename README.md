Hi, I'm hydraxic, or Samuel Xu. <br />

I started coding back when I was 8 or so and started with Scratch. I love working on projects for fun and game development is definitely my favourite.

## Personal Projects

I work only on personal projects, and for some reason it always turns into something public. <br />

From 2019 - 2020, I developed Roblox games and now I have ~5 million visits combined (2022). I learned LuaU from making these games. <br />

From 2021 - 2022, I created a Discord bot to help people flip items on the Auction House in Hypixel Skyblock in Minecraft. It was to practice Python after returning to it from LuaU, but this Discord bot now has its own server with almost 700 users all using the bot (2022-09-24). <br />

From May 2022 - present, I'm developing a mobile sudoku game right now. This was to learn using Unity and C# but I guess it turned into something bigger. <br />

Dec 2022 - present. Started some 3D game development for fun.
